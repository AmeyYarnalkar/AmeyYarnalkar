# Hi, I'm Amey 👋

I’m a software engineer in training with a **strong focus on problem-solving, 
machine learning fundamentals, and system design**.

Right now, I’m deliberately narrowing my focus — building depth instead of 
chasing breadth. My goal is to become a high-impact engineer who understands 
**how things work under the hood**, not just how to use tools.

---

## What I’m Focused On Right Now

- 🧠 **Data Structures & Algorithms (Java)**  
  Deep problem-solving, pattern recognition, and clean implementations  
  (arrays, strings, trees, DP, graphs — with explanations, not memorization)

- 🤖 **Machine Learning (Foundations → Applied)**  
  Linear algebra intuition, probability, optimization, and ML algorithms  
  implemented from scratch before using libraries

- 🏗️ **System Design (LLD + HLD)**  
  Scalable backend systems, trade-offs, databases, caching, networking, and APIs

## What You’ll Find on This GitHub

- 📂 **DSA repositories** with:
  - Clear intuition
  - Edge cases
  - Time & space complexity
  - Pattern-based organization

- 📓 **Technical notes**:
  - DSA patterns
  - ML math intuition
  - Design concepts explained simply

- 🧪 **ML experiments & notebooks**:
  - Algorithms from scratch
  - NumPy / math-driven implementations
  - Small, focused experiments (no fluff projects)

> This GitHub reflects **active learning and real thinking**, not polished hype.

## Current Goal

Build strong fundamentals so that when I ship ML,
they are:
- explainable
- scalable
- and technically sound

If you’re reviewing this profile, you’re seeing **progress in motion**, 
not a finished product — and that’s intentional.
